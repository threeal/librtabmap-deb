set(CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION
  "RTAB-Map library and standalone application
 RTAB-Map (Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping) is a RGB-D, Stereo and Lidar
 Graph-Based SLAM approach based on an incremental appearance-based loop
 closure detector. The loop closure detector uses a bag-of-words approach to
 determinate how likely a new image comes from a previous location or a new
 location. When a loop closure hypothesis is accepted, a new constraint is
 added to the mapâ€™s graph, then a graph optimizer minimizes the errors in the
 map. A memory management approach is used to limit the number of locations
 used for loop closure detection and graph optimization, so that real-time
 constraints on large-scale environnements are always respected. RTAB-Map can
 be used alone with a handheld Kinect, a stereo camera or a 3D lidar for 6DoF
 mapping, or on a robot equipped with a laser rangefinder for 3DoF mapping.")
